# **Cloudflare WARP Local Network Detector**

A simple, containerized TLS server designed to enable Cloudflare WARP's "Managed Network" feature for easy local network detection. This allows the WARP client to intelligently detect when it is on a trusted network and apply custom profiles, such as excluding local traffic from the tunnel. This container simplifies the process of setting up the [required TLS detection endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/managed-networks/).

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* A host machine (Linux, macOS, or Windows) with a static or DHCP-reserved IP address. A Linux host is recommended for easily running the service on system boot.  
* Docker Desktop installed.  
* A Cloudflare Zero Trust account.  
* Git installed on your host machine. (You can use a browser to download instead of launching Git, just [follow this link](https://github.com/nutmegitconsulting/warp-detector/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to get the .zip file and unpack them all into a folder called warp-detector.)

## **Quick Start Guide**

This guide will walk you through building the container, generating your unique certificate, and starting the server.

**1\. Clone the Repository**

Open a terminal (or PowerShell) and clone the project files:

```
git clone https://github.com/nutmegitconsulting/warp-detector.git  
cd warp-detector
```

**2\. Build the Docker Image**

Build the local container image from the source code. This image will be named warp-detector-server.

```
docker build -t warp-detector-server ./src
```

**3\. Run the One-Time Interactive Setup**

* This command starts the container in interactive mode (-it) and automatically removes it when finished (--rm). Its only purpose is to create your certificate files and display the information you need. The -v warp-certs:/certs part creates a persistent volume named warp-certs where your new certificate will be safely stored.

```
docker run -it --rm -v warp-certs:/certs warp-detector-server setup
```
* Follow the On-Screen Prompts:  
   * The script will prompt you to enter a **hostname** (the default is warp-detector.homelan.local).  
   * It will then generate the certificate and print a summary of the critical information.
* Copy the Output: The script will display the SHA-256 Fingerprint. You will need this for the CloudFlare setup

**4\. Start the Container**

Run the container in detached mode to start the container in the background. It will automatically restart unless manually stopped.

```
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name warp-detector -p 0.0.0.0:4443:4443 -v warp-certs:/certs --init warp-detector-server
```

**Note:** Note, this command serves the TLS certificate on every IP of the host machine. If you want to lock to a specific IP, replace 0.0.0.0 with the specific IP. If your host machine only ever has a single IP, you shouldnâ€™t have to worry about this.


## **Configuration**

### **Part 1: Configure Cloudflare Zero Trust**

1. Log in to your Zero Trust dashboard and go to **Settings \> WARP Client**.  
2. Find the **Network locations** section and click **Add new**.  
3. Fill out the form with the following details:  
   * **Name:** A descriptive name, like Home LAN.  
   * **Host and Port:** The hostname you chose during setup followed by :4443 (e.g., warp-detector.homelan.local:4443).  
   * **TLS Cert SHA-256:** Paste the fingerprint you copied from the setup step.  
4. Click **Save**.

### **Part 2: Configure DNS**

For the WARP client to find your new container, you must make its hostname reachable.

* Method 1 (Recommended): Local DNS Server  
  If you run a local DNS server (like Pi-hole), create an A Record that points the hostname to the internal IP address of the machine running the Docker container.  
* Method 2: Edit hosts File  
  On each client device, manually edit the hosts file to add the entry provided by the setup script's output.  
  * **Windows:** C:\\Windows\\System\\drivers\\etc\\hosts  
  * **macOS / Linux:** /etc/hosts

### **Part 3: Create a Cloudflare Device Profile**

Create a new profile to apply custom rules when a device is on your managed network.

1. In the Zero Trust dashboard, navigate to **Settings \> WARP Client \> Device profiles**.  
2. Click **Create new profile** and give it a name (e.g., On-Prem LAN).  
3. Create an expression with the following:  
   * **Selector:** Managed network  
   * **Operator:** is  
   * **Value:** Select the network location you just created (Home LAN).  
4. Under **Split Tunnels**, click **Override** and add the IP address ranges of your local network to the **Exclude** list (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24).  
5. Save the profile and drag it to the top of the list to give it the highest priority.
6. For more details, refer to the [official CloudFlare documentation on Device Profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/device-profiles/).

## **Making the Container Run on Startup**

For a reliable setup, the container should start automatically with the host machine.

* **On Linux:** The \--restart unless-stopped flag you already used is sufficient. Docker's systemd service will automatically start the container on boot. This is the recommended method for a headless container.  
* **On Windows / macOS:** Ensure that Docker Desktop is configured to launch on system startup ("Start Docker Desktop when you log in"). The \--restart policy will ensure your container starts whenever the Docker daemon is running.
